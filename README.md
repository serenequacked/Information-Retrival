# Information-Retrival

This project aimed to predict the sentiments of tweets scraped from business news twitter accounts. Through this project, we want to create a retrival system and ranking systems that determines whether or not a piece of information is objective or not. 


# Labelling of Tweets 
Two members in the team were tasked with labelled the records and below is an overview of the labelled data: 
  Number of labelled tweets: 2164 / 14060 (~15% labelled)
  Number of opinionated tweets: 1015 (~47 % opinionated, ~53% neutral)
  Positive to Negative ratio: 550:465 (~54:46)

Every Tweet was labelled to be either "Opinionated" (O) or "Neutral" (NT). If the tweet is "Opinionated", it would have a "Positive" (P) tone or a "Negative" (N) tone. 

If a tweet is "Opinionated" and "Negative", it is labelled ON

If a tweet is "Opinionated" and "Positive", it is labelled OP

If a tweet is "Neutral", it labelled NT
