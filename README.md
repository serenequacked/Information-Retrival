# Information-Retrival

This project aimed to predict the sentiments of tweets scraped from business news twitter accounts. Through this project, we want to create a retrival system and ranking systems that determines whether or not a piece of information is objective or not. 14060 tweets were scrapped and 2164 tweets were labelled (15%) of the full dataset. 


# Labelling of Tweets 
Every Tweet was labelled to be either "Opinionated" (O) or "Neutral" (NT). If the tweet is "Opinionated", it would have a "Positive" (P) tone or a "Negative" (N) tone. 

If a tweet is "Opinionated" and "Negative", it is labelled ON

If a tweet is "Opinionated" and "Positive", it is labelled OP

If a tweet is "Neutral", it labelled NT
